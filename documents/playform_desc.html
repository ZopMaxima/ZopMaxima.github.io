    PlayForm focuses on platforming and parkour with an active ragdoll avatar. The player may choose to run pre-made obstacle courses or enter sandbox mode to make their own physics-based contraptions.

    PlayForm was my fourth project with CodeHatch. At this point I was the final remaining employee, trusted to find my own direction and follow through with tasks. I contributed frequently at design meetings and took full ownership of my system design and implementation.

    The emphasis of my workload in PlayForm was to create modular systems that interact with physics. Notably during this project, I constructed and programmed nearly 1000 interactive obstacles with varying physics features and destructible parts. Automation is key.
