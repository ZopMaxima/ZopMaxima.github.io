    PlayForm focuses on platforming and parkour with an active ragdoll avatar. The player may choose to run pre-made obstacle courses or enter sandbox mode to make their own physics-based contraptions. I contributed to frequent design meetings, designed user interfaces, and the implemented of hundreds of placable obstacles with varying physics and destruction features.
