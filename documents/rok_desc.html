    Reign of Kings entered the early days of the survival multiplayer genre with great popularity. At the core of gameplay, players collect materials, build castles, form alliances, and fight for the social title of king.

    Using the code of StarForge, Reign of Kings was developed remarkably fast, even with a reduced team size. I took ownership of the UI, settings, lobby, and inventory systems in addition to the regular addition of gameplay features and consumable items. As content release dates drew near I joined the QA team in company-wide internal tests.

    The high player population interestingly led most of my post-release efforts into maintaining server stability and developing custom cheat detection / prevention systems. Reign of Kings was engaged in an arms race against cheaters to keep gameplay fair, and maintaining control over the situation was a very valuable experience.
