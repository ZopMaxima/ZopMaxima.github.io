    Reign of Kings entered the early days of the survival multiplayer genre with great popularity. At the core of gameplay, players collect materials, build castles, form alliances, and fight for the social title of king. The game was developed remarkably fast from the code of StarForge, and with the high player population it interestingly led most of my post-release efforts into server stability and cheat prevention.
