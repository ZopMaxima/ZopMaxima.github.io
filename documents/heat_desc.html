    HEAT is a survival multiplayer game with massive upgrades from the systems of Reign of Kings. Players can live a pioneer life in the eastern United States, mining, logging, farming, etc... Social systems and pre-built locations in a massive map attract players to crossroads and divide interests. I enjoyed working with the design team throughout this project to plan new gameplay systems and balance items over time. For the last two years of HEAT's development I worked solo to release roadmapped content (mainly the single-player "Homestead" mode) and patch exploits.
