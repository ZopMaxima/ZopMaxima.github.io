    HEAT is an ambitious survival multiplayer game that incorporates the features of its competitors and pushes for complex AI features in a player-modified world. Players can live a pioneer life in the eastern United States, mining, logging, farming, etc... to earn their riches. Rewarding social positions and pre-built towns in a massive map attract players to crossroads and divide interests.

    HEAT took the time to clean up technical debts and make massive upgrades from the systems inherited from Reign of Kings. I frequently joined the design team throughout this project to plan new gameplay systems and balance items over time.

    For the last two years of HEAT's development I worked independently to release roadmapped content: the single-player "Homestead" mode, balance updates, and exploit fixes. I had a hand in every part of the game from here on, programming, building, testing, and uploading for each patch.
