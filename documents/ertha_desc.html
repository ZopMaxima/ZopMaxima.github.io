    Ertha is an economic and political simulation that represents Earth. Players can buy NFTs for ownership, terrain-editing, and city-building permissions of the ~260,000 sectors across the earth's surface. This phase of development upgraded the assets and gameplay of terrain-editing, city-building, and in-world avatars while expanding the database to share customized sectors of land online.
