    Based on novel ideas for the time, StarForge featured precedural voxel terrain, resource-harvesting, and base-building. Players could explore an infinite world, digging and harvesting from the caverns to the sky.

    I joined the late stages of this StarForge's development for my junior year, and the largest team that I have worked with at ~20 members. My primary role in the project was to upgrade the user interface and add client-server networking to old single-player systems.
